The first few classes of Mod 0 have given me good tips in professionalism--that I should show up everyday and treat Turing like it is my dream job.

I also have learned that students show better success in the program if they front load as much work as possible. Things break and it will be much better trying to trouble shoot if there is a time buffer built in.

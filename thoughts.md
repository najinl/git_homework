The first few classes of Mod 0 have given me good tips in professionalism--that I should show up everyday and treat Turing like it is my dream job.

I also have learned that students show better success in the program if they front load as much work as possible. Things break and it will be much better trying to trouble shoot if there is a time buffer built in.

I will try and stick to the calendar that I've laid out for completing tasks during the remainder of Mod 0 and throughout the program.

I am committed to asking for help if something takes me more than 20-30 minutes to figure out without any progress at all during the remainder of Mod 0.

Thank you to Mason F for his optimism and clear/concise direction in these first two sessions!
